2. Ensemble Strategy - using Supertrend, Marubozu and Ichimaku cloud (Novel)
ADX, or Average Directional Index, is a technical indicator designed to measure the strength of a trend in a financial market. It quantifies the strength of a trend on a scale from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating a stronger trend. 
3. Dyanamic Stoploss 
It is based on ATR volatility and highest price for Ensemble strategy. 
4. Mutiple Timeframe Strategy
The true range indicator is taken as the greatest of the following: current high less the current low; the absolute value of the current high less the previous close; and the absolute value of the current low less the previous close.
5. To address any potential overfitting, we validated our strategy by generating random signals and dividing the dataframe into two halves. We then checked these random signals against the strategy. Since there was no mismatch, it indicates that our strategy is not overfitted, and no forward-looking bias is present.
